The ASAP Python Toolbox CFTime Package

The ASAP Python Toolbox's CFTime package is a collection of tools to 
convert and interpret time coordinates according to the CF Conventions.
While this is, in some ways, "reinventing the wheel", it has the advantage 
of being a pure-Python implementation, and does not depend on a NetCDF
I/O library or the UDUNITS library.
